# Paraphrasing-of-sentence
Paraphrasing the work of others is one of the most important skills. The transformation of
the words, phrases and ideas of different authors into your own words avoids plagiarism.
However, please note that you still need a citation or citations as appropriate.
Paraphrasing is the skill of synthesising the opinions and evidence provided by one author
or by different authors, to reach useful conclusions and insights. It is an advanced skill,
which can improve the flow, development and overall cohesion of your ideas. 

This means changing the tense of the verb. Changing the active to the passive can
transform the words in a sentence. In the example below, the original “they learnt” is
changed to “that were learnt” and the original “will face” is changed to “are to be faced”
You could also replace “that were learnt” to “that they were taught”.
